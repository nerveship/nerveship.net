                Yesterday we had the first showing of summertime game events that'll take place instead of E3, which seems to be all but dead.<br><br>

                Sony took a shot at things and whilst I wasn't interested in most of what they showed, there was some really cool stuff I'll talk about, and some stuff that disappointed me.<br><br>

                LET'S GET THE BIG ONE OUT OF THE WAY FIRST!<br><br>

                <b>ALAN WAKE II GOT A NEW TRAILER AND IT'S RELEASE DATE HAS BEEN SHOWN!</b></a>

                <div class="video">

                </div>

                The game looks insane and there's so much about it that I find interesting. You have Alex Casey (MAX FUCKING PAYNE!!!) making an appearence (being written into reality to save Alan from the dark place?)<br><br>
                
                With Remedy working on Max Payne 1 and 2 remakes at the same time, there's bound to be info/story related to Alan in there too!<br><br>

                The game releases on October 17th, 2023 and I can't fucking wait. It's been so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so long since we've been able to play as Alan and find out exactly what he's up against.<br><br><br>

                We also had <b>Revenant Hill</b>, which appears to be a new video game from the core creatives who worked on Night in The Woods!<br><br>
                
                I loved that game, so I'm looking forward to seeing what they achieve with it. It has a cool art style and an interesting premise, being set in 1919.

                </div>

                Another cool looking title was Phantom Blade Zero, an Action RPG that seems to be set in China. There's lots of cool character design and action sequences in this trailer. Give it a look!

                </div>

                The Talos Principal 2 got a trailer. The first is a game I've been interested in a while and it's made me think about it again. Maybe I'll return to it soon!

                </div>
                There were a few disappointments, but I've decided I can't be bothered talking about them! There's a lot of cool games coming out this year, and I'm hoping that down the line I can get to making my own pages about the games I love and generally want to talk about. I'm kind of just using this blog as a diary, at this point, but it's fun to open up visual studio code and just ramble for a bit about shit and not really care about whether anyone sees it or not.<br><br>

                See you again sometime!
