                I've had a lot of thoughts recently, so I thought I'd ramble and post some shit here.<br><br>

                I've struggled with a lot ever since finishing school, mostly mentally. It would take way too long to catalogue every up and down that I went through throughout this period, but I'd like to talk a little bit about where I'm at now and maybe about things I did to get here in the first place.<br><br>

                I found that I would constantly deny things within myself but it would be obfuscated below ten layers of denial and brainfog. One day I was browsing around and I read a post where someone spoke about journalling and being honest with yourself. Usually when I read things like that, I would acknowledge they were probably right, but deny that it would apply to me or that it would be of any benefit to me (ignoring the reason why I was reading it in the first place)<br><br>

                So... I listened, bought a journal and started writing about things. I started essentially having a conversation with myself and walking step-through-step through my anxieties and worries. Surprisingly, I found that it helped a lot. It was suddenly a lot easier to put things into perspective and understand where I was in life and felt about things.<br><br>

                All in all, I started focusing less on my past and future, instead focusing on my immediate surroundings and finding more and more reasons to live. I've struggled with depression, anxiety and suicide for a long time. I feel I've found a decent place in this world, and I'm not as afraid for all of that to change, as it eventually will whenever I do more and more things.<br><br>

                The biggest change I struggled with immensely was putting off my hapiness or enjoyment of life to say to myself:<br><br>

                <i>"Well, it's fine. I'll be happy in X number of years when I've achieved this, and have that, and I've done this..."</i><br><br>

                This poisoined my brain for so long and caused me to deny my surroundings and think that my life was way, way worse than it was. Sure, I still have mental issues and problems, but generally speaking I have wonderful people around me and can make it through. It wasn't all that bad.<br><br>

                I'm still figuring everything out, but I feel like I have significantly more reasons to live, and I feel that even when bad times come, I'll be able to navigate them with a healthier mindset.
