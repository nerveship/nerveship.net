        <div class="info">my name is nerveship<br><br>
        this is my site that you've found, i'm still building things!<br>
    <br>
    i'm a musician, sound designer, writer, game developer, all-rounder artist<br><br>
i've became increasingly disinterested in social media, so thought i'd make my own site instead. <br><br>
here, you'll be able to find posts about my art, things i like and in general just anything i can think of to toss on here.<br>
